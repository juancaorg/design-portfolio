## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

It's been a while since I used CSS Grid, but I can't stress enough how good is [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co) on getting you up to speed.

To re-learn and build the Grid for this project I watched a little bit of Kevin Powell's video [Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU).

And I got the logic for the Image Slider from this [article](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/javascript-slider-how-to-make-one/) by Warren Davies.

More specifically, the following code:

```js
function changeSlide(moveTo) {
  if (moveTo >= slides.length) {
    moveTo = 0;
  }
  if (moveTo < 0) {
    moveTo = slides.length - 1;
  }

  slides[currentSlide].classList.toggle("active");
  navlinks[currentSlide].classList.toggle("active");
  slides[moveTo].classList.toggle("active");
  navlinks[moveTo].classList.toggle("active");

  currentSlide = moveTo;
}

document.getElementById("nav-button--next").addEventListener("click", () => {
  changeSlide(currentSlide + 1);
});
document.getElementById("nav-button--prev").addEventListener("click", () => {
  changeSlide(currentSlide - 1);
});
```

This is my implementation:

```js
// Function that will keep track of the slide number.
function changeSlide(moveTo) {
  if (moveTo >= slides.length) {
    moveTo = 0;
  }

  if (moveTo < 0) {
    moveTo = slides.length - 1;
  }

  currentSlide = moveTo;
  moveSlider(currentSlide);
}

// Event listeners for each navigation button.
// Previous navigation button.
prevButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  changeSlide(currentSlide - 1);
});

// Next navigation button.
nextButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  changeSlide(currentSlide + 1);
});
```

Similar, of course. But different because of the needs of this project.

### Continued development

I'll build another portfolio single-page to learn more about it!
